# üìò Analysis of Algorithms: Time and Space Complexity

## üß† What is Algorithm Analysis?

Algorithm analysis is the process of evaluating the **efficiency** of an algorithm in terms of:
- **Time Complexity**: How long it takes to run.
- **Space Complexity**: How much memory it uses.

This helps developers **choose the most efficient algorithm** for solving a problem, especially when the input size becomes large.

## ‚è±Ô∏è Time Complexity (Big O Notation)

### üîç What is Big O Notation?

Big O Notation describes **how an algorithm scales** with input size `n`. It represents the **worst-case time** required for execution.

| Big O | Name                | Description                                | Example                  |
|-------|---------------------|--------------------------------------------|--------------------------|
| O(1)  | Constant Time        | Executes in the same time regardless of input | Accessing an array item |
| O(log n) | Logarithmic Time | Halves input each time                     | Binary Search            |
| O(n)  | Linear Time         | Grows directly with input size              | Simple loop over array   |
| O(n log n) | Linearithmic   | Log factor added to linear                 | Merge Sort, Heap Sort    |
| O(n¬≤) | Quadratic Time      | Nested loops                              | Bubble Sort              |
| O(2‚Åø) | Exponential Time    | Doubles each time                         | Solving subsets          |
| O(n!) | Factorial Time      | All permutations                         | Travelling Salesman (Brute Force) |

## üõ†Ô∏è How is Time Complexity Measured?

1. **Count the most frequent operation** (e.g., comparison, assignment).
2. Focus on the **input size `n`**.
3. Identify how the number of operations grows with `n`.

> Example: In a loop `for i in range(n):`, the loop runs `n` times ‚Üí **O(n)**.

## üìå Why is Time Complexity Important?

- Helps **predict performance** before running the code.
- Essential for **scaling systems**.
- Lets us **compare algorithms** efficiently.
- Saves **cost, time, and computing resources**.

## ‚úçÔ∏è Tips for Students

- Always analyze algorithms before coding.
- Use `O(1)` or `O(log n)` solutions when possible.
- Be cautious with `O(n¬≤)` or worse in large input cases.
