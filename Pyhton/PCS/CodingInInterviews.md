# What Do Companies Expect in Technical Coding Interviews?

When preparing for technical coding rounds, it’s important to understand not just what kind of code you write, but also *how* you communicate and present your solution. Here’s a detailed guide on what companies expect from your code and interview approach.

---

## 1. Code Should Work Correctly (Compile & Produce Correct Output)
- Your code **must run without errors** and produce the **correct output** for the problem.
- Interviewers typically test your code against multiple test cases, including edge cases.
- Code that compiles but fails on important test cases usually scores poorly.

---

## 2. Code Should Be Understandable & Readable
- **Readable code is critical**. Your code should be clear enough that others can understand it easily.
- Use **meaningful variable and function names** (avoid single-letter names like `a`, `b`, `x` unless in very small scopes).
- Write **clear and simple logic**. Avoid unnecessary complexity.
- Adding brief comments or narrating your thought process helps interviewers follow along.

---

## 3. Code Should Handle Edge Cases & Errors Gracefully
- Consider boundary conditions such as empty inputs, large inputs, or invalid inputs.
- Demonstrating that you think about edge cases shows maturity and attention to detail.

---

## 4. Good Coding Practices Are Valued
- Break your code into **modular functions/methods**, not one large block.
- Avoid hardcoding values.
- Use consistent indentation and formatting.
- Prefer simple and efficient solutions regarding time and space complexity.

---

## 5. Interviewers Care About Your Problem-Solving Approach
- **Communicate clearly** as you solve the problem.
- Verbalize your plan before you start coding:
  - What is the problem asking?
  - What inputs and outputs are expected?
  - What approach do you plan to take? (e.g., brute force, optimized algorithm)
- Discuss trade-offs if there are multiple solutions.
- Write clean, understandable code to help communicate your approach.

# How to Explain Your Approach During Interviews: Example Answers & Tips

### Step 1: Understand the Problem
> "So, just to confirm, the problem is asking me to find the index of the target value in a sorted array, or return -1 if it’s not present. Is that correct?"

### Step 2: Clarify Constraints and Edge Cases
> "Are there any constraints on the size of the input array? Should I consider empty arrays or duplicate elements?"

### Step 3: Describe Your Approach
> "I plan to use binary search because the array is sorted, which will give us a time complexity of O(log n). We will repeatedly divide the search interval in half until we find the target or determine it doesn’t exist."

### Step 4: Outline the Steps Before Coding
> "First, I'll initialize two pointers — left and right — at the start and end of the array. Then, while left <= right, I'll check the middle element. If it matches the target, return the index. If it’s less, move left to mid + 1; if greater, move right to mid - 1."

### Step 5: Write Code Cleanly and Narrate
> (While coding) "Here, I’m naming the variables clearly to keep the code understandable. The loop continues until the pointers cross. This ensures we search all relevant elements."

### Step 6: After Coding, Discuss Edge Cases & Complexity
> "This approach handles empty arrays gracefully since the while condition will fail immediately. The time complexity is O(log n), and the space complexity is O(1)."

# Summary

- **Correctness**: Your code must compile and pass all test cases.
- **Readability**: Code must be easy to understand with meaningful names and clear structure.
- **Edge Cases**: Show awareness of boundary conditions.
- **Communication**: Clearly explain your problem-solving approach.
- **Professionalism**: Clean, maintainable code reflects your readiness for real-world development.
