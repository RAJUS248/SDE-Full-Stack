# Distributed File Systems (DFS) — Detailed Notes

## What is a Distributed File System?

A **Distributed File System (DFS)** is a way to store and access files over multiple computers connected through a network. Instead of saving all data on a single machine, the data is spread across many machines (called nodes). Yet, it looks like one big file system to users and applications.

### Why Do We Need DFS?

Imagine you have a huge amount of data — too big for one computer to handle efficiently. For example, think of:

- Social media platforms with billions of photos and videos.
- Scientific research storing terabytes of data from experiments.
- Businesses processing massive transaction logs.

Storing this data on one computer would be slow, unreliable, and costly. A DFS solves this by:

- **Splitting the data** into smaller pieces and storing them across multiple machines.
- **Replicating data** so even if some machines fail, data is safe.
- Letting many computers **work in parallel** to read or write data, making processes faster.

## Key Characteristics of Distributed File Systems

| Feature               | Explanation                                                         |
|-----------------------|---------------------------------------------------------------------|
| Data Distribution     | Files are broken into chunks stored on different machines.          |
| Fault Tolerance       | Copies of data (replicas) exist on multiple machines to prevent loss.|
| Scalability           | You can add more machines to store more data or improve speed.      |
| Transparency         | Users see one file system, unaware of data’s physical location.     |
| Concurrent Access     | Multiple users can read or write files simultaneously.              |

## Hadoop Distributed File System (HDFS)

### What is HDFS?

HDFS is the distributed file system designed specifically for **Hadoop**, a popular big data framework.

- It stores huge files (gigabytes to terabytes) by splitting them into large blocks.
- It runs on **clusters of regular, inexpensive computers** (commodity hardware).
- Designed to work reliably despite hardware failures.

### Why is HDFS Important?

HDFS allows Hadoop to process massive datasets by:

- **Storing data close to where computation happens**, reducing slow network transfers.
- Ensuring **data is safe even if some machines break**.
- Supporting high-speed data access suitable for large-scale batch jobs.

## How HDFS Works — Architecture Explained

### 1. NameNode (The Master)

- Think of it as the **file system manager** or **librarian**.
- Keeps a record of:
  - Which files exist.
  - Which blocks make up each file.
  - Where each block is physically stored in the cluster.
- It doesn’t store actual data, only metadata (like a directory index).

### 2. DataNodes (The Workers)

- These are the machines that actually store the **data blocks**.
- They send regular updates (heartbeats) to the NameNode saying "I’m alive and here’s what I have."
- When a client wants to read or write data, it talks directly to DataNodes for actual data transfer.

---

## How Files are Stored in HDFS

- Files are split into **large blocks** (default size: 128 MB or 256 MB).
- Each block is **copied multiple times** (default 3 replicas) and stored on different DataNodes.
- Example:  
  A 640 MB file would be split into 5 blocks (4 x 128 MB + 1 x 128 MB).  
  Each block is stored on 3 different nodes → total 15 block copies.

---

## Reading and Writing Data in HDFS

### Writing Data

1. The client contacts the NameNode to find where to store data blocks.
2. The client sends data to a chain of DataNodes (called a pipeline).
3. DataNodes write and replicate the blocks.

### Reading Data

1. The client asks the NameNode for locations of the data blocks.
2. The client reads the blocks directly from DataNodes, often in parallel for speed.

---

## Fault Tolerance in HDFS

- If a DataNode fails or stops sending heartbeats, NameNode marks it as dead.
- NameNode replicates missing blocks to other DataNodes to maintain replication factor.
- This ensures data is **never lost** and always available.

---

## Why Large Blocks?

- Larger blocks mean fewer metadata entries in the NameNode.
- Better performance for sequential data access common in big data workloads.
- Reduced overhead in network communication.

---

## HDFS Use Cases and Limitations

### Use Cases

- Processing large-scale datasets (log files, images, videos).
- Batch processing systems like MapReduce.
- Data analytics, machine learning on huge datasets.

### Limitations

- Not designed for low-latency data access (not good for real-time data).
- Not suitable for lots of small files due to metadata overhead.
- Write-once-read-many model — files are typically not modified after being written.

## Conclusion

Distributed File Systems like HDFS are essential for handling massive data volumes that single machines cannot store or process efficiently. By distributing data, replicating it for fault tolerance, and enabling parallel access, HDFS supports the big data ecosystem and applications like Hadoop MapReduce. Understanding HDFS helps you grasp how large-scale data analytics platforms work under the hood.
