# Security and Access Control by Operating Systems

---

## 1. Introduction to Security and Access Control in OS

- **Security** in an operating system means protecting data, programs, and resources from unauthorized access, modification, or destruction.
- **Access Control** is a mechanism that restricts access to resources (files, devices, memory, etc.) based on permissions or policies.
- The OS acts as a **guardian** to enforce these rules, ensuring only authorized users/processes can perform certain actions.

## 2. Historical Perspective: Old Times vs Modern Times

### Old Times (Early Operating Systems)

- Early OSes (1960s-70s) had **minimal security mechanisms**.
- Systems often used **simple password checks** or even none at all.
- Access control was often coarse, e.g., user vs. admin, or no user separation.
- Example: Early batch systems or single-user systems had limited multi-user controls.
- **Hardware limitations** restricted complex security designs.
- Mostly **manual controls** outside OS (physical security, controlled terminals).

### Modern Times

- Security is **critical and complex** due to networking, multi-user environments, and more sensitive data.
- OS supports:
  - **Multi-level access controls** (users, groups, roles).
  - **Fine-grained permissions** on files, processes, and system calls.
  - **Authentication** (passwords, biometrics, tokens).
  - **Authorization policies** su
