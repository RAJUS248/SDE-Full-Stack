# Computer Networking for Engineering Graduates

## üìú 1. Introduction: A Brief History of Computer Networks

Computer networks evolved out of the need to share information efficiently and reduce redundancy. In the 1960s, the U.S. Department of Defense developed **ARPANET**, the first practical network that used **packet switching**. It was the precursor to the modern Internet.

### The First Network
- **ARPANET (1969)**: Connected four university computers.
- Used **NCP (Network Control Protocol)** initially.
- Replaced by **TCP/IP** in 1983, forming the foundation of today's Internet.

# üåê History of the First Computer Network: ARPANET

## üìÖ Year of Creation
**1969**

## üè¢ Created By
**ARPA (Advanced Research Projects Agency)**  
Department of Defense, United States

## üéØ Purpose of ARPANET

The key motivations behind building ARPANET:

- **Resource Sharing**  
  Allow researchers across universities and defense institutions to share expensive computing resources remotely.

- **Communication Resilience**  
  Design a network that could continue functioning even if parts were destroyed during war (especially nuclear attacks).

- **Advance Research Collaboration**  
  Enable fast data exchange between geographically distributed researchers.

## üöÄ Key Innovations Introduced

| Concept                 | Description                                                                 |
|------------------------|-----------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| **Packet Switching**   | Breaks data into small packets for efficient and fault-tolerant transmission. |
| **Decentralized Network** | No single point of failure; data could reroute through multiple paths. |
| **Remote Login (Telnet)** | Users could log into distant machines as if they were local.             |
| **File Transfer Protocols** | Allowed files to be moved between computers.                         |

## üì° First Communication Event

- **Date:** October 29, 1969  
- **From:** UCLA (University of California, Los Angeles)  
- **To:** Stanford Research Institute (SRI)

**Message Sent:** `"LOGIN"`  
**What Happened:**  
Only `"LO"` was transmitted before the system crashed ‚Äî marking the first use of ARPANET and the beginning of Internet history.

---

## üåç Legacy and Impact

- ARPANET is considered the **precursor to the modern Internet**.
- Inspired the development of **TCP/IP protocols** (introduced in 1983), which became the core of the global Internet.
- Paved the way for technologies like **email**, **remote computing**, and **distributed systems**.

## ‚öôÔ∏è 2. Hardware Level: How Data Travels

### 2.1 Copper Cables
- Uses **electrical signals**.
- Ethernet cables: **Category 5e, 6, 6a (Cat5e, Cat6, Cat6a)**.
- Each cable contains **twisted pairs** to reduce electromagnetic interference.
- Data is modulated into **voltage changes** (e.g., using NRZ, Manchester encoding).

### 2.2 Optical Fiber
- Uses **light pulses** to transmit data.
- Faster, lower latency, immune to EMI.
- Data is converted to light using a **laser or LED**.

### 2.3 Wireless Communication (Wi-Fi, Cellular)
- Uses **radio waves**.
- Modulated via standards like **802.11 (Wi-Fi)** or **4G/5G**.
- Data is sent as electromagnetic waves between antennas.

---

## üîÑ 3. Data Conversion: Software to Electrical Signal

1. **Application data** ‚Üí serialized (e.g., JSON, HTML).
2. Data passed through **OS network stack**.
3. OS splits into **packets**, adds headers.
4. Network card converts binary into **electrical/light/radio signals**.
5. On the other side:
   - Signal is received by network card.
   - Reconstructed into binary.
   - OS stack reassembles and delivers to application.

## üß† 4. Networking Protocols Overview

### 4.1 Hardware Level Protocols
- **Ethernet (IEEE 802.3)**: Local area wired networks.
- **Wi-Fi (IEEE 802.11)**: Wireless LAN protocol.

### 4.2 Network Interface Layer
- **MAC Addressing**: Device-level identity.
- **Network drivers**: Interface between OS and NIC (Network Interface Card).

### 4.3 Network Layer
- **IP (Internet Protocol)**: Assigns IP addresses, routes packets.

### 4.4 Transport Layer
- **TCP (Transmission Control Protocol)**: Reliable, connection-oriented.
- **UDP (User Datagram Protocol)**: Faster, no guarantee.

#### TCP vs UDP
| Feature | TCP | UDP |
|--------|-----|-----|
| Connection | Connection-oriented | Connectionless |
| Reliability | Reliable | Unreliable |
| Use Case | Web, email | Video, games, VoIP |
